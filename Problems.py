	Example 1:

	Input: n = 12
	Output: 3 
	Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

def problem2():
	'''
	Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

	a mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

	2:abc
	3:def
	4:ghi
	5:jkl
	6:mno
	7:pqrs
	8:tuv
	9:wxyz

	Example:

	Input: "23"
	Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
	Note:

	Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.
