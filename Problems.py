def problem1():
	'''
	Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

	Example 1:

	Input: n = 12
	Output: 3 
	Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
	Example 2:

	Input: n = 13
	Output: 2
	Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

def problem2():
	'''
	Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

	a mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

	2:abc
	3:def
	4:ghi
	5:jkl
	6:mno
	7:pqrs
	8:tuv
	9:wxyz

	Example:

	Input: "23"
	Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
	Note:

	Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

def problem3():
	'''
	Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
	An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
	You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	11110
	11010
	11000
	00000

	Output: 1
	Example 2:

	Input:
	11000
	11000
	00100
	00011

	Output: 3
